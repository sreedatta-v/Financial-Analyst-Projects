# Sales-Revenue

## Challange 
For the Maven Pizza Challenge, I’ll be playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. I've been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operations, and just received the following note:  

Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!  

Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.  

### Ask
1. What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2. How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3. What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?

## Data Source 
The public dataset is completely available on the Maven Analytics website platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis in the Data Playground. The specific individual datasets at hand can be obtained at this link below: [https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/maven-pizza-challenge)

## Project Objective 
To analyze pizza sales revenue, identify trends, and provide insights to improve sales.

Steps to Follow:
1. Define the Scope and Objective:  
• Analyze sales revenue data to identify trends and patterns.  
• Understand the factors affecting pizza sales (e.g., time of day, day of the week, promotions, etc.).  

2. Data Collection:  
• Gather relevant data such as sales transactions, date and time of sales, item details, revenue, etc.  
• Assume you have a dataset named pizza_sales.csv with columns like TransactionID, Date, Time, Item, Quantity, Price, and Revenue.  

4. Data Preparation:  
• Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies or errors.  
• Combine data from different sources into a single dataset if necessary.  
• Use tools like Excel or SQL for data cleaning and preparation.  

6. Load Data into Tableau:  
• Open Tableau and connect to your data source.  
• Load your prepared dataset into Tableau.

7. Create Initial Visualizations:   
• Start by creating basic visualizations to understand the data.  
• Use different chart types like bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and scatter plots to visualize various aspects of the data.
